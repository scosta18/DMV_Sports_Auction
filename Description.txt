Here's my understanding of your project goals:

Project Overview:

You’re building a soccer player auction app where users can bid on players.
The app will have two main user roles: Admin and Bidders.
Admin Role:

Login with a 4-digit key to access admin functions.
Approve new bidders: When a bidder registers, their profile will initially be in a “pending” state. Only after admin approval can they participate in bidding.
Admin-only access: Admin will have access to certain restricted routes for managing the app (like approving users).
Bidder Role:

Registration: Bidders create a profile on the app, which admins then approve.
Approved Access Only: Only approved bidders can log in and participate in bidding.
Tech Requirements:

Authentication: We’ll use JWT for authenticating users (both admin and bidders) and protecting specific routes.
Hosting: The app will be hosted online (e.g., on Heroku) so users can access it over the web.
Step-by-Step Development:

Step 1: Set up the environment and basic server with Express.
Step 2: Create routes for admin login, bidder registration, and admin approval.
Step 3: Set up JWT authentication to protect routes based on user roles.
Step 4: Deploy the app to Heroku for access.
